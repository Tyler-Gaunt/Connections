# Python Connections
A reverse engineered version of the New York Times came Connections. In this game the player is given a grid of 16 words and they have to select words that they think fit into the same category.

# How to Play
The game chooses 4 random categories each with 4 words similar to each other. These are then shuffled together and placed in a 4 x 4 grid. The player must then guess which words are in the same category
